# What about simpleCV?
This repository provides LaTeX templates for a **simple CV** and **cover letter** with a sleek and
elegant look. It is intended to be used not only by the modern STEM graduate but also by anyone who
seeks a straightforward, comprehensible and easy to modify implementation. Part of our design was
inspired by the gorgeous [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv) as
well as [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).
